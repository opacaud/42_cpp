# Project 09: 42_cpp

## An introduction to C++ language after months of learning C and its features, through small exercises.

Each folder is a module about one new key aspect of C++.
Each module is several small exercises, increasing in difficulty.
</br>

The subjects are available in every folder.
But in a nutshell, no matter what folder you end up in, you can just run ```make``` and launch the executable that has been created.
</br>

As I gained confidence, I started writing longer and more thorough mains to test my code.
